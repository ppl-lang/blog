{ch A Simple Problem
        
    Suppose we have to write a simple function to 'enthuse' a sentence. The function should do this by transforming an input string as follows:
    {list
        {el remove leading and trailing spaces}
        {el convert all letters to uppercase}
        {el append an exclamation point}
    }

    For example, feeding the function with {c "  Hello bob "} should return {c "HELLO BOB!"}.
}
