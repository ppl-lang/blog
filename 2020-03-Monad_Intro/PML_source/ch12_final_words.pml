{ch Final Words

    As hinted in it's title, this article is an {i introduction} to monads. It doesn't cover the full spectrum of monads, it doesn't show other useful examples of monads (Maybe monad, IO monad, state monad, etc) and it completely ignores 'category theory', the mathematical background for monads. For those who want to know more, an abundance of information is already available on the net.

    Hopefully this article helps to get the gist of monads, see their beauty, and understand how they can improve code and simplify life.
    
    "HAPPY MONADING!"
